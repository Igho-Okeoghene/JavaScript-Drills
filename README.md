## Overview

A major challenge for me was figuring out a way to store the scores and get the timer working all at the same time, roughly took me two days of trial and error.
P.S: I absolutely love when my code is free of bugs...I literally do flip flops, so hours of trial and error, googling and watching videos, paid off and now we have this beautiful game.
Feel free to give me feedback on what you think about this game...I would absolutely Love to hear from you... [Chat Me Up!](#dev)
